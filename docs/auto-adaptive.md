# Auto-Adaptive Control

The **Auto-Adaptive Control** feature transforms your Ecodan heat pump into a smart, self-learning system. It intelligently adjusts the heat pump's operation to match the unique thermal properties of your home, maximizing both comfort and energy efficiency.

When enabled, this feature continuously monitors the room temperature and compares it to the setpoint. It then fine-tunes the heat pump's flow temperature to correct any persistent errors, ensuring your home is always perfectly comfortable using the minimum amount of energy.

The system is designed to be highly robust and accounts for real-world scenarios such as:
* **System Saturation**: It pauses the learning process if the heat pump is already running at 100% capacity.
* **Defrost Cycles**: It intelligently ignores temperature data during defrost cycles to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions.
* **Short-Cycling**: It works alongside the **Short-Cycle Mitigation** feature to ensure stable operation.

## Persistent Learning

A significant advantage of this system is that all learned parameters, specifically the crucial **`heating_curve_offset`** and **`cooling_curve_offset`**, are automatically saved to the ESP32's flash memory.

Unlike the native Mitsubishi auto-adaptive function, which can lose its learned data after a power cycle, this implementation ensures that a reboot or power outage **does not cost time to re-learn**. The system immediately resumes operation with its last known optimal settings, ensuring continuous efficiency.

---

## Important Note on Operating Mode

For this feature to function correctly, the heat pump must be set to a **Fixed Flow Temperature** mode for both heating and cooling. The Auto-Adaptive algorithm takes over the role of the built-in heating curve by dynamically adjusting this fixed setpoint.

## Proactive Control with Setpoint Bias

The **`Auto-Adaptive: Setpoint Bias`** parameter unlocks the controller's most advanced capability: **proactive operation**. While the core algorithm is highly efficient at *reacting* to current conditions, the Setpoint Bias allows it to *anticipate* future events.

A "bias" is a temporary, externally controlled adjustment to the primary setpoint. By applying a positive or negative bias, an external system (like Home Assistant) can instruct the controller to pre-heat or pre-cool the house in response to upcoming events.



This transforms your controller from a reactive system into a predictive one, enabling strategies like:
* **Load Shifting**: Pre-heating the house with a positive bias (e.g., `+1.0°C`) during off-peak electricity hours and then applying a negative bias (e.g., `-1.5°C`) during expensive peak hours. The thermal mass of your home acts as a battery.
* **Solar Gain Compensation**: Applying a negative bias (e.g., `-0.7°C`) on a cold but sunny morning to prevent the system from overheating the house, letting the "free" energy from the sun do the work instead.

---
## Predictive Short-Cycle Prevention

This feature predicts imminent short cycles that can occur when the home's heat demand is lower than the heat pump's minimum power output.

To mitigate this, the algorithm proactively adds a `+0.5°C` boost to the learned curve offset, forcing a higher feed temp. This action may cause a minor room temperature overshoot, which is then automatically corrected by the main auto-adaptive algorithm in subsequent learning cycles.

## Configuration Parameters

All parameters are adjustable in real-time from the Home Assistant interface.

# Getting Started with Auto-Adaptive Control

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Physical Thermostat Connection (If Applicable)

This guide assumes a common scenario where an external room thermostat (like a Tado, Nest, etc.) is wired to the **IN1** terminal on your heat pump's FTC board. This thermostat is responsible for sending the main heat request signal to the heat pump. It should work with the remote wireless thermostat as well.

### Step 2: Set Up the Temperature Feedback Loop

The Auto-Adaptive algorithm needs to know the **current temperature** being measured by your external thermostat. You must send this value back to the ESPHome controller. If you are using a mitsubishi wireless thermostat or [esphome-ecodan-remote-thermostat](https://github.com/gekkekoe/esphome-ecodan-remote-thermostat), you can skip the rest of this section and step 3.

You can do this in two ways:

* **Via Home Assistant UI**: Create an automation in Home Assistant that copies the temperature from your thermostat's sensor to the `Auto-Adaptive: Current Room Temperature Feedback` number entity.
* **Via REST API**: Use an external system or script to post the temperature directly.

Example REST API call to set the feedback temperature to 21.5°C:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://esp_ip/number/auto-adaptive__current_room_temperature_feedback_z1/set?value=21.5" -d ""
curl -X POST "http://esp_ip/number/auto-adaptive__current_room_temperature_feedback_z2/set?value=22.0" -d "" # only for 2 zones
```

Example Home Assistent automation:
```yaml
- id: SyncTemperatureToAdaptiveController
  alias: Sync Room Temp to Auto-Adaptive Controller
  description: "Ensures the heat pump's feedback value matches the kantoor current temp"
  trigger:
    - platform: template
      value_template: >-
        {{ state_attr('climate.kantoor', 'current_temperature') | float(0) !=
          states('number.ecodan_heatpump_auto_adaptive_current_room_temperature_feedback_z1') | float(0) }}
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: number.set_value
      target:
        entity_id: >-
          number.ecodan_heatpump_auto_adaptive_current_room_temperature_feedback_z1
      data:
        value: "{{ state_attr('climate.kantoor', 'current_temperature') | float(0) }}"
  mode: single
```

Put the automation in a file `automations.yaml` and include that file in the main home assistant `configuration.yaml`.
```yaml
automation: !include automations.yaml
```
Restart HA, and the automation should be visible in Settings > Automations & scenes. 

### Step 3: Set target temperatures (setpoint)
If you are using an external thermostat, you need to adjust the Zone 1 and Zone 2 temperature climate entities to reflect the setpoint of that external thermostat. This probably does not change often and can be done manually once. If it does change often, you can use an automation similar to the one in the previous step to sync the setpoint.

```yaml
- id: SyncSetpointToAdaptiveController
  alias: Sync Room Setpoint to Auto-Adaptive Controller
  description: Ensures the heat pump setpoint always matches the main setpoint
  trigger:
    - platform: template
      value_template: >-
        {{ state_attr('climate.kantoor', 'temperature') | float(0) | round(1) !=
          state_attr('climate.ecodan_heatpump_zone_1_room_temp', 'temperature') | float(0) | round(1) }}
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: climate.set_temperature 
      target:
        entity_id: climate.ecodan_heatpump_zone_1_room_temp
      data:
        temperature: "{{ state_attr('climate.kantoor', 'temperature') | float(0) | round(1) }}"
  mode: single
        #temperature: "{{ (state_attr('climate.kantoor', 'temperature') * 2) | round(0) / 2.0 | float }}" if rounding to nearest half is needed
```

### Step 4: Set Outside temperature source (Optional)
If you want to use an external outside temperature sensor, then select the HA / REST API option.

```yaml
- id: SyncOutsideTemperatureToAdaptiveController
  alias: "Sync Outside Temperature to Auto-Adaptive Controller"
  description: ""
  trigger:
    - platform: template
      value_template: >-
        {{ states('sensor.buienradar_temperature') | float(0) !=
          states('number.ecodan_heatpump_auto_adaptive_outside_temperature_feedback') | float(0) }}
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: number.set_value
      target:
        entity_id: >-
          number.ecodan_heatpump_auto_adaptive_outside_temperature_feedback
      data:
        value: "{{ states('sensor.buienradar_temperature') | float(0) }}"
  mode: single
```

### Step 5: Configure Initial Parameters

In Home Assistant, navigate to your dashboard and set the initial parameters for the controller on the **"Auto-Adaptive Settings"** tab.

1.  **Set the Heating System Profile**: Choose the option from the `Auto-Adaptive: Heating System Type` dropdown that best matches your home (`Underfloor Heating`, `Underfloor Heating + Radiators`, or `Radiators`).
2.  **Set the Heating Curve Slope**: Adjust the `Auto-Adaptive: Heating Curve Slope` slider. A good starting point for underfloor heating is `0.4`-`0.7`, while radiators often need a steeper slope like `0.8`-`1.2`.
3.  **Set Safety Limits**: Adjust the `Auto-Adaptive: Max. Heating Flow Temperature` slider to a value that is safe for your floors (e.g., `38.0°C` for UFH). Do the same for the cooling limits.
4.  **Set Thermostat Overshoot Compensation (optional)**: Adjust the `Auto-Adaptive: Thermostat Overshoot Compensation` slider to match the known behavior of your thermostat. For example, the official Mitsubishi wireless thermostat has an  overshoot of 1.0°C, so you would set this slider to 1.0.

### Step 6: Activate the System

Now you are ready to let the algorithm take control.

1.  **Set Heat Pump to Fixed Flow Mode**: On your main Mitsubishi thermostat or control panel, ensure that the active zone(s) are set to **Fixed Flow Temperature** mode for heating (and cooling, if applicable). This is critical, as it allows the ESPHome controller to have full control. Set a start fixed flow temperature (only needed for the first usage).
2.  **Enable Auto-Adaptive Control**: In Home Assistant, turn **ON** the `Auto-Adaptive: Control` switch.

## Monitoring Operation

Once enabled, the system is now active. The algorithm will run every 10 minutes to calculate and set a new optimal flow temperature.

You can monitor the learning process by viewing the history of these key sensors in Home Assistant:

* **`Auto-Adaptive: Heating Offset (Z1/Z2)`**: This is the most important sensor to watch. You will see this value slowly change over hours and days as the system fine-tunes itself. If it's trending down, the system is learning to be more efficient. If it's trending up, it's learning to be more powerful.
* **`Auto-Adaptive: Dynamic Learning Rate`**: This sensor shows how aggressively the system is currently learning. A higher value means it is reacting to a larger temperature error, while a value near zero means the room temperature is stable and close to the target.

---

## Advanced Control: Using the Proactive Bias

During operation, you can use the `Auto-Adaptive: Setpoint Bias` slider to proactively influence the controller. This allows you to create automations in Home Assistant that anticipate future events.

* **Example 1: Pre-heating for cheap energy**: Set a positive bias (e.g., `+1.0°C`) to pre-heat the house during off-peak electricity hours, using your floor as a thermal battery.
* **Example 2: Anticipating sunshine**: Set a negative bias (e.g., `-0.7°C`) to reduce heating on a cold but sunny morning, letting the "free" solar gain do the work instead of the heat pump.
